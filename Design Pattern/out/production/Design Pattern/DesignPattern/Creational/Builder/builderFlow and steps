Student --> builder method --> builder const()--> all setters
                                                   |
                                                   |
                                                   build() method --> students const()--> return Student object

Steps BUILDER PATTERN :

1. Create a static Builder class inside required class
2. Create a static method called builder() -> which returns object of Builder class
3. Create setters inside Builder class, which set the value and also return the Builder obj
4. Create a build() method inside Builder class, which does the validations and returns a required class object
5. make constructor private for Builder and Student
